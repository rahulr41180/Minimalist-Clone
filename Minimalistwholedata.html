            FAQs5: "5. What products can or cannot be used with AHA PHA BHA peeling solution?",
            FAQs11: "The peeling solution contains three active ingredients - 25% alpha hydroxy acid (a blend of Glycolic acid, Lactic acid & Mandelic acid), 5% poly hydroxy acid (Gluconolactone) and 2% beta hydroxy acid (Salicylic acid). They all act as excellent exfoliants. Glycolic acid works on the skin's surface and breaks through the multiple layers of the dead skin cells and helps in their effective shedding. It also fights the signs of sun damage and reduces fine lines and wrinkles. Salicylic acid penetrates deep into the pores and whisks out the skin debris and excess sebum trapped within them. Thus, it removes clogs. It also provides anti-microbial resistance to the skin and offers an overall treatment for mild acne.",
            FAQs22: "Chemical peels have a balanced pH and are readily available in the market (both OTC and prescription-grade medications). They are completely safe for topical applications, provided they match your needs and fit your skin type. It is usually not recommended for hypersensitive or compromised skin. Minimalist peeling solution (25% AHA + 5% PHA + 2% BHA) contains a high concentration of acids, but in combo with aloe juice and Turmeric extract that calms the irritation associated with exfoliation. Always perform a patch test over a small area of your skin. Observe it for the next 48 hours. If no irritation or burns (redness) occur, you are ready to go with the product.",
            FAQs33: "  It is advised that the peeling solution should not be used on sensitive, abraded, broken, or compromised skin. The peeling solution is for unisex consumption. There is no specified starting age range for using chemical peels, however it's safe for people in their 20's to start using it. Teenagers should avoid using it or consult a dermatologist before doing so. The peeling solution should not be used during pregnancy because it contains salicylic acid, which may harm the applicant. In the case of breastfeeding women, it is better to have a word with your skincare specialist before proceeding with the product.",
            FAQs44: "Chemical peels accelerate the cell turn over, and some people might undergo a purging phase as soon as they start with the skincare acid routine. However, this shall subside in 2-3 weeks. If the purge lasts longer than 6 weeks, quit using the product, and consult a dermatologist. He/she may revise the frequency of application of the product or adjust the dosage. Or, suggest an alternative.",
            FAQs55: "Hyaluronic acid is an excellent addition to your skincare routine. It hydrates the skin and helps it to retain moisture for a long time. It makes sure that the acids (used in the peel) are not too mean or harsh to your skin. Also, Niacinamide will raise the pH of the acids, if you use it right after the chemical peel, and make them less effective. But you can still include it in your daily routine and skip it on weekends when AHA/PHA/BHA is used. You can include vitamin C in our daily routine, alongside the AHA/PHA/BHA peeling solution. You can use them at alternate times, i.e., if peeling was done at night, you could use Vitamin C serum in AM.",

            Howtouse2: "Follow it up with Minimalist ultra-hydrating 2% Hyaluronic acid to ensure newly revealed skin is well hydrated.",

Because of its larger molecule size compared to Glycolic acid (molecular weight 178 vs. 76 for Glycolic acid), it penetrates the skin slowly, hence offering lesser irritation. Further, PHAs are proven to provide up to 50% protection against UV radiation, hence they provide conditioning effects to skin without increasing sensitivity to UV light.",

            Sciencebehindthisproduct1: "Retinol (Vitamin A), is the gold standard & most proven ingredient for anti-aging and skin renewal. Collagen, a type of protein, makes up over 70% of our skin and among many functions, it gives skin its structure, and elasticity. As we age, our body's ability to produce this protein decreases. Further, there are enzymes called matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), that break down collagen. Environment aggressors like UV, increases the activity of this enzyme, hence exposure to UV rays results in faster sagging of skin. ",
            Sciencebehindthisproduct2: "Retinol primarily works by inactivating the MMP enzymes, resulting in increase in amount of collagen in our skin. It also increases the cell turnover rate, which results in older cells getting replaced by newer cells. This particular property makes Retinol very effective in treatment of acne as well.",
            Sciencebehindthisproduct3: "However, like other Vitamins, Retinol is highly unstable. It oxidises in presence of air, light or water. Exposure to any of these will result in reduction of active retinol in the product, hence loss of efficacy with time. This serum is water-free and uses Squalane as the base ingredient. Also the bottle is UV Protective, making it a highly-stable & powerful Retinol serum.",

Approximately 6% of the solar spectrum is UVR (200 - 400 nm), 52% is visible light (400 - 760 nm), and the remaining 42% is IR (760 - 10^6 nm). Fortunately, the most energetic form of UVR, UVC (100 - 280 nm) does not reach ground level because it is effectively absorbed by the stratospheric ozone layer. Of the UVR that impinges upon skin’s surface, about 5% comprises UVB and 95% comprises UVA. UV within 280 nm - 400 nm induces photo damage including sunburn, pigmentation, wrinkle formation, and cancer.",

It penetrates the superficial layers of the skin, down to the basal layer of the epidermis, where it generates harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in inflammation,  sunburn and skin ageing. UVA, on the other hand, has lower energy than UVB, but is present in larger amounts. UVA radiation (315 - 400 nm) penetrates deeper in the skin, and reaches the dermis.

Our body naturally produces HA, but with age and UV exposure, the skin ability to produce HA decreases, and we need to supplement it externally. It contains humectant, which attracts moisture, thus giving this molecule a unique capacity to retain water. Hyaluronic Acid is the reason our skin looks hydrated, plump, and young. Lack of it leads to wrinkles, fine lines, and dull skin.",

Highly recommended in the mid-20s and early 30s as with age, the natural percentage of Hyaluronic Acid in the skin decreases; thus, we need to shift to HA supplements or topical applications (serums) of HA. Since Hyaluronic Acid is a hydrating booster, it works well with any skin type, whether the skin is sensitive, oily, or prone to breakouts. Although side effects from Hyaluronic Acid are rare, we recommend patch tests before including any new skincare product into your routine.",
            FAQs44: "Our body (average 70kg human body) contains roughly 15 grams of the hyaluronan naturally present at the innermost layer of epidermis where it binds with water and helps retain moisture to the skin. It also supports nutrient transmission in the epidermis. As per a study, increased HA content increased the presence of Retinoic Acid in the epidermis, thus boosting the skin’s ability to fight aging signs. Also, it promotes skin healing. When applied topically on the skin, hyaluronic acid serum reduces aging signs like wrinkles and fine lines and gives a plump, hydrated, glowing complexion. (Note the HA molecule needs to be small enough to sink in for deep hydration and anti-aging effect)",

            FAQs44: " Lactic acid is not only milder than glycolic acid but the mildest of AHAs. However, this does not make Lactic acid less potent. Both have their list of pros and cons. Lactic acid is slower and mild but delivers the same result as glycolic acid, so good for people with sensitive skin.",
            FAQs55: " AHA stands for Alpha Hydroxy Acids, while BHA stands for Beta Hydroxy Acids. AHAs (lactic, glycolic acid, etc.) work on the surface to promote cell turnover and, thus, be better suited for dry and sensitive skin. In contrast, BHA (e.g., salicylic acid) penetrates deep into pores to remove dirt and sebum, thus better suited for oily and acne-prone skin. If your skin is not hypersensitive, then try both and see which one works best for you.",

            Sciencebehindthisproduct1: "Our skin functions as a barrier and protects underlying tissues from infection, desiccation, chemicals, and mechanical stress. Disruption of this function results in increased transepidermal water loss or TEWL and this in turn results in skin conditions like atopic dermatitis and chronic skin diseases. Moisturizers restore the integrity of the SC (stratum corneum), reduce water loss by forming an occlusive film over SC and replenish skin lipids and other compounds.",
            Sciencebehindthisproduct2: "As the intercellular lipids are removed (mostly due to cleansing or other mechanical stresses), the edges of the corneocytes fold creating friction as the hand is rubbed across the skin surface. Moisturizers address this by delivering emollients, which are thin oily substances capable of depositing between the desquamating corneocytes. Emollients play a key role in efficient functioning of a moisturizer.",
            Sciencebehindthisproduct3: "Second major ingredient of moisturisers are humectants. They are able to increase the water content of the skin by enhancing water absorption from the dermis into the epidermis (or from outer environment into the epidermis). Hydroscopic properties of humectants allow them to attract and hold water molecules, but in lower humidity / dry environments, and in absence of any occlusives, excessive water can be lost from the dermis through evaporation into the environment. A combination of humectants and occlusives, help hold water inside the skin.",

It contains high concentration of emollients and occlusives, along with multiple hydrators for balanced and intense all-day moisturization. Marula Oil at 5% is an excellent emollient and not only nourishes and softens skin, but also repairs skin as it has high concentration of oleic acid and linoleic fatty acid. As per a clinical study (conducted by supplier), a cream containing 5% Marula Oil increased skin capacitance value by 17.7 %. Higher capacitance signifies higher water content of the skin.

            FAQs5: "5. Is salicylic acid good for acne treatment?",
            FAQs11: "Any active ingredient that promotes cell turnover can cause purging in certain people, especially with sensitive or acne-prone skin. It is an entirely natural and normal response to active ingredients. Salicylic acid pushes trapped sebum and oil to the surface, and thus those acnes which were supposed to appear later pops up early. The natural cell shedding cycle in healthy young women is 28 days. So, purging usually subsides in 3-4 weeks.",
            FAQs22: "Salicylic acid is a clever exfoliant that sheds off dead skin cells by penetrating deep into the pore lining and inhibiting the sebum production. It refines pores by solubilizing with oil/keratin present in the pores and giving a clean, bright, and blemish-free skin. Research also shows that SA has anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties that help to reduce and prevent mild acne. However, for persistent acne, we recommend 2% Benzoyl Peroxide Serum.",
            FAQs33: "There are no non-negotiable side effects of salicylic acid, but all acids are subjective to the user's skin. Salicylic acid is best suited for oily and combination skin as it visibly reduces greasiness and acne formation. In the case of combination skin, the T-zone is usually more oily, and you can focus more on that area.",
            FAQs44: "A 0.5 - 2% of Salicylic acid in serums, face washes, or a moisturizer is safe to use daily, but concentrated salicylic acid alone is not. Minimalist 2% Salicylic Acid is optimal and safe for all types of skin, and it is tolerated very well even when used daily. Apply 2-3 drops on cleansed face, preferably at night (PM) to slough off all the clumped dirt/debris/sebum in the pores, leaving a fresh surface for cells to breathe.",
            FAQs55: "Salicylic acid boosts natural cell turnover and unclogs pores, thus preventing future breakouts and blackheads.

This entire process takes place under the surface of the skin. Unlike oil-based SA products, our water-based ultra-light formulation quickly sinks in pores and smoothens keratin. (Note many brands claim that their oil-based Salicylic acid works better as it provides extra hydration, but that will give much less active SA available at the inner layers for deep exfoliation). By softening the glandular lipids and proteins, it also breaks the link (desmosomes) present between each cell, giving more space to cell turnover.

            Sciencebehindthisproduct1: "Tranexamic acid is a new generation molecule that inhibits melanin synthesis by interfering with the interaction between melanocytes and keratinocyte through inhibition of plasminogen/plasmin system. External skin disruptors, such as UV light or injuries (like acne), cause the keratinocytes in our skin to produce plasminogen, that further start several processes like inflammation, increased tyrosinase activity, melanocyte differentiation, andtransfer of melanosomes to upper skin layers. Tranexamic acid decelerates these processes by interfering with plasmin activity, and hence in turn, indirectly inhibiting melanogenesis. Studies have shown that Tranexamic acid, when applied topically, shows results similar to Hydroquinone in reduction of hyperpigmentation. It is also one of the most proven ingredient for treatment of Melasma.",
            Sciencebehindthisproduct2: "Hydroxyphenoxy Propionic Acid (Radianskin) complements Tranexamic Acid as it has an innovative mechanism blocking the release of melanin by the melanocytes, an alternative to the inhibition of tyrosinase. HPA reduces melanogenesis by up to 86% and shows a greater depigmenting effect than ascorbyl glucoside, kojic acid and arbutin, and equivalent efficacy to hydroquinone without cytotoxicity.",
            Sciencebehindthisproduct3: "The formula also contains exfoliating acids like Mandelic Acid (3%) and Salicylic Acid (0.3%) which gently remove the dead cells from the top of the skin, boosting the performance of Tranexamic Acid and Hydroxyphenoxy Propionic Acid, hence accelerating the reduction of hyperpigmentation and melasma.",

            Sciencebehindthisproduct1: "Our skin functions as a barrier and protects underlying tissues from infection, desiccation, chemicals, and mechanical stress. Disruption of this function results in increased transepidermal water loss or TEWL and this in turn results in skin conditions like atopic dermatitis and chronic skin diseases. Moisturizers restore the integrity of the SC (stratum corneum), reduce water loss by forming an occlusive film over SC and replenish skin lipids and other compounds.",
            Sciencebehindthisproduct2: "As the intercellular lipids are removed (mostly due to cleansing or other mechanical stresses), the edges of the corneocytes fold creating friction as the hand is rubbed across the skin surface. Moisturizers address this by delivering emollients, which are thin oily substances capable of depositing between the desquamating corneocytes. Emollients play a key role in efficient functioning of a moisturizer.",
            Sciencebehindthisproduct3: "Second major ingredient of moisturisers are humectants. They are able to increase the water content of the skin by enhancing water absorption from the dermis into the epidermis (or from outer environment into the epidermis). Hydroscopic properties of humectants allow them to attract and hold water molecules, but in lower humidity / dry environments, and in absence of any occlusives, excessive water can be lost from the dermis through evaporation into the environment. A combination of humectants and occlusives, help hold water inside the skin.",

It provides deep penetrating moisture to the skin, stimulates epithelization to provides wound healing and anti-inflammatory effects. This makes Vitamin B5 an excellent ingredient as it shows immediate effects as humectants and reduces TEWL with continued use by repairing skin barrier. Most moisturisers in the market contain B5 at 1-2% concentration only. We have used it at high concentration of 10% to deliver maximum benefits of this ingredient.",

            Sciencebehindthisproduct1: "The primary role of a cleanser is to remove dirt, sebum/oil, pollution and other contaminants from the surface of the skin. Key part of any cleansing system is the surfactants that do the heavy lifting of cleansing. Surfactants have a hydrophilic head and a lipophilic tail that allow them to bind oily soils and solubilize them, resulting in removal of oil & dirt.",
            Sciencebehindthisproduct2: "However, because of this very property, surfactants can be drying as well if not formulated properly. They are unable to identify between oil/sebum and our skin's natural lipids. Also, they can interact with proteins in the skin, causing our skin's barrier to break down. This cleanser uses 2 very mild surfactants, namely Cocamidopropyl Betaine (CAPB) and Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate (SLMI). Both of these cleanser are measured on Zein Scale for mildness. Zein Scale uses a skin like protein, called Zein Protein, that is derived from corn protein. If a surfactant dissolves more Zein Protein, it would also dissolve higher quantity of skin protein and would end up having higher Zein Score. Higher Zein score means harsher surfactant, and vice-versa. While SLS dissolves the highest amount of Zein Protein and is taken as control with Zein score of 100, SLMI stands at around 50 and CAPB at around 16, making them very mild surfactants. The combination provides good cleansing without drying the skin.",
            Sciencebehindthisproduct3: "This cleanser also contains 2% Hydroxy Acids in 2 forms - BHA (Salicylic Acid) and LHA (Capryloyl Salicylic Acid). Salicylic Acid is a lipid-soluble hydroxy acid and is miscible with epidermal lipids and sebaceous gland lipids. It thus dissolves dead skin cells and sebum from inner walls of pores, revealing fresh skin underneath.",
            Sciencebehindthisproduct4: "Salicylic Acid is a relatively smaller molecule with molecular weight of 138 g/mol, and about 58% of Salicylic Acid is able to penetrate our outermost skin layer (Stratum Corneum). This results in deeper cleaning, exfoliation and anti-acne benefits. Capryloyl Salicylic Acid (LHA) on the other hand is a larger molecule with molecular weight of 264 g/mol, making it almost double the size of Salicylic Acid. Because of this, only 6% of LHA penetrates past Stratum Corneum, making it excellent for superficial skin exfoliation. Also, because of added fatty chain, LHAs are more oil loving than BHAs, resulting in slower penetration and better cell-by-cell exfoliation.",
            Sciencebehindthisproduct5: "The balanced combination of BHA and LHA gives a multi-level exfoliation without irritating & drying the skin.",

            Heading: "A daily, gentle exfoliating, face cleanser. It combines BHA + LHA (Salicylic Acid + Capryloyl Salicylic Acid) in 2% concentration, which provides deep cleansing, pore decongestion & sebum reduction without drying out the skin.",
            WhyitIsAwesome1: "Contains Salicylic Acid (BHA) that penetrates deep into the skin & scoops out the dirt, debris, and sebum, hence reducing the oily look of the skin",
            WhyitIsAwesome2: "Formulated with Capryloyl Salicylic Acid (LHA), which unlike Salicylic Acid, stays on outer layer of skin and provides gentle exfoliation, revealing soft skin. The combination provides multi-level cleansing",
            WhyitIsAwesome3: "Boosted with anti-bacterial Zinc and several hydrating & soothing ingredients like Xylitylglucoside, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Allantoin, Pentyle Glycol for hydrating overall after-feel",
            WhyitIsAwesome4: "Formulated with 2 very mild sulfate-free surfactants (cleansers) that provide optimum cleaning without stripping skin lipids or proteins",
